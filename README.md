# Intelligent Traffic Monitoring & Vehicle Recognition System

### About
Modern cities face heavy traffic and crowded parking — tasks that are tedious and error-prone when done manually. The Intelligence Traffic Monitoring System (ITMS) automates vehicle monitoring and traffic control by combining image processing, OCR, machine learning and Google APIs.
Main goals: accurate automatic license-plate recognition, traffic-light control using live traffic data, a smart fine system, and the ability to track lost/stolen vehicles via plate detection + maps.

### Features
1. License plate number recognition.
2. Matching the plate number with Database.
3. Intelligence traffic light control using live traffic density data.
4. Show traffic density of particular area for some duration of month in form of graph.
5. Online Vehicle license registration.
6. Smart fine system.

###Applications
1. Automated track the location of stolen vehicle
2. Anti-Theft/ Vehicle detection.
3. Traffic light automation ,no requirement of Traffic police.
4. Smart fine /E Challan Systems.
5. Car Parking / Automatic Toll Deduction.
6. Law Enforcement
7. VIP/Ambulance path Clearance
8. Help the government to take

● Increase the efficiency of existing transport infrastructure
● Develop a license plate recognition system,
● Build a smart fine system and in future enhancement automated fine systems for vehicles.
● Live Traffic detection system and automated traffic light control system.
● Predict the traffic density using machine learning for specific areas by its previous data.
● Automated lost vehicle detection system and information to administration.
● Handle traffic congestion using automated light control system.

### Installation
* Clone the project.
* Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
* Run `yarn start` to view the project in action.

### OpenCV Demo to Count Vehicles
* In "countingCars" directory, run 'python count.py' .

### License plate detection
go to vehicle_number_by_its_pate folder and type python3 licenseplateDetection.py 1.jpg
